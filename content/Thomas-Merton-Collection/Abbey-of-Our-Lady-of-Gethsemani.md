The Trappist monastery which Merton entered on December 10, 1941 is near Bardstown, Kentucky. The Trappists follow the Rule of Saint Benedict, living a contemplative life of prayer and work. The monks gather seven times a day to celebrate the Liturgy of the Hours, singing praise to God and listening prayerfully to the word of God.

Fr. Terrance Connolly borrowed five images of the abbey from Thomas Merton for the Boston College exhibit, later returning them. The image shown here is from the James H. Forest â€“ Thomas Merton Collection.
