The James H. Forest - Thomas Merton Collection (MS.1989.021) includes letters written by Merton to Fr. Sweeney, Fr. Terence Connolly, and Fr. Brendan Connolly. There are also some copies of letters written by the Jesuits to Thomas Merton. In these letters, the reader can learn about Merton’s donations of signed materials to Boston College

Connolly. The correspondence covers a wide variety of topics; the few shown here were selected to emphasize the relationship that Merton formed with each of these Jesuits in response to their interests and their roles at Boston College.
