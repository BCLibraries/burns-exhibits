The Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani is a Trappist abbey and follows the Rule of Saint Benedict. This copy of the Rule, titled [The Holy Rule of Our Most Holy Father Benedict](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21369972240001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=bcl&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US), was given to Boston College by Thomas Merton. This edition is printed in Latin and English. With the book is an exhibit card made by Fr. Connolly for the 1949 exhibit. Prior to that exhibit, Thomas Merton had not been identified as the translator. The Merton Collection includes many pamphlets written anonymously for the Abbey. When Thomas Merton donated them to Boston College, Fr. Terence L. Connolly was careful to confirm that he was the author.
