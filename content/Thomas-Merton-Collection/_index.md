**It seems I am working for the Jesuits these days,”** Thomas Merton wrote to Francis W.  Sweeney, S.J. on October 13, 1962. Merton had corresponded with Fr. Sweeney for years, so his wry humor was known to the Jesuit. He goes on to say, “How do I get considered an honorary member of the Society? Or would that wreck you?” Although joking with Sweeney, Fr. Merton had spent many hours translating the work of Alfred Delp, S.J., a German priest who had been imprisoned, tortured, and executed by the Gestapo in 1945, and he had given several copies of that book to Boston College, so he was working for the Jesuits. After this humorous quip, he quickly goes on to note how much he admires Fr. Delp. Indeed, Thomas Merton had an ongoing admiration for Jesuits, beginning with St. Ignatius, founder of the Society of Jesus.

Thomas Merton, (1915-1968), Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance (OCSO, also commonly known as Trappists), had begun corresponding with Fr. Sweeney  years before his best-selling autobiography, The Seven Storey Mountain, captivated the nation. Fr. Merton gave the typescript of the autobiography to Sweeney, beginning collaboration between himself and Boston College. 

At the time that Merton donated the typescript, Terence L. Connolly, S.J.  headed the Boston College Library. By loaning Fr. Merton research materials in exchange for signed copies of his publications, Fr. Connolly quickly accumulated a collection of Thomas Merton materials. Fr. Connolly was very savvy in developing the special collections for the university, and saw this donation as an opportunity to garner interest in the library. He prepared an exhibit, “The Work of Thomas Merton,” and arranged to have Dr. Daniel Walsh, who was described by Merton as the man “destined in a providential way to shape and direct my vocation,” give a talk for the exhibit opening in 1949. 2000 people attended.

Brendan C. Connolly, S.J.  was named Director of the Boston College Library after the death of Fr. Terence Connolly. The new librarian was eager to continue developing the Merton Collection, and made sure that the “inter-library” loan system established by Fr. Terence Connolly remained in place. The collection eventually grew to include drawings by Merton, photographic images, and correspondence.

This exhibit reproduces some of the 1949 exhibit and explores some of Merton’s correspondence with the three Boston College Jesuits. The correspondence between Fr. Merton and these three Jesuits provides readers a window into which they can view him as an author as well as a monk. The personalities and interests of the Jesuits also are revealed.
