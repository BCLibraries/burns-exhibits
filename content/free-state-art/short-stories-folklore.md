Tomás Ó Criomhthain, a native of the Great Blasket Island off the Kerry coast, wrote the famous autobiography An tOileánach (1929) also published by An Gúm, later translated by Robin Flower (1881-1946), Deputy Keeper of Manuscripts at the British Museum, as The Islandman (1929). Allagar na hInise describes the people and events of the years 1918-1923 on the Great Blasket. Tim Enright translated Allagar na hInise as Island Cross-Talk in 1986.
