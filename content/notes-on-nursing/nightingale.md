Florence Nightingale’s appointment to and efforts in the English General Hospitals in Turkey during the Crimean War are credited with the ultimate professionalization of nursing. Donations were gathered to recognize her work and used to set up the first nursing school. Nightingale wrote *Notes on Nursing* in 1859, as a clear, practical guide for home nursing, but it was also used as a textbook in the School for Training Nurses at St. Thomas’s and King’s College Hospitals.  

As Josephine A. Dolan writes in *Nursing in Society*, Nightingale’s *Notes on Nursing*  sold “15,000 copies within a month of publication, and by the time of Florence Nightingale’s death well over 100,000 [copies] had been purchased.” *Notes on Nursing* “gave an enormous stimulus to the study of this subject in England. According to Miss Nightingale nursing ought to signify the proper use of fresh air, light, warmth, cleanliness, quiet, and the selection and administration of diet - all at the least expense of vital force to the patient” (*Encyclopedia Britannica*, 11th edition).

Sanitary conditions at this hospital were so deplorable that a royal inquiry was put in place to investigate the horrible illnesses and sufferings of soldiers at the barracks hospital in Scutari. In this letter, written from Scutari, Nightingale writes to an acquaintance, a Mrs. Lewis, and laments the toll that dysentery has taken on some people of their mutual acquaintance. In February 1855, the death rate at the barracks hospital in Scutari where Nightingale was posted was 42%; in less than a few months, the death rate had decreased to 2%.

           headline="Front. Letter from Florence Nightingale to Alice Fisher, dated July 23, 1881, from the [Josephine A. Dolan Collection of Nursing History, MS1988-04.](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/l6ucgu/ALMA-BC21352781560001021)  Box 1 Folder 2.">}} This letter offers a glimpse into the student-teacher relationship between Alice Fisher and Florence Nightingale. Born in England in 1839, Fisher enrolled in the Nightingale Training School Home for Nurses at St. Thomas's Hospital, London in 1875 and went on to become a Nightingale nurse of unusual ability.  Fisher became the matron of Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, England and later the Lady Superintendant of Nurses at Philadelphia Hospital. In this letter, Nightingale asks if Fisher knows any nursing students who might be interested in enrolling at Nightingale's School for Nurses at St. Thomas's Hospital, "We have always, of course, many more applications than we can admit, but, also of course, not always of the right calibre *(sic)*.”
