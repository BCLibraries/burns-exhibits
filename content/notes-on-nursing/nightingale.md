Florence Nightingale’s appointment to and efforts in the English General Hospitals in Turkey during the Crimean War are credited with the ultimate professionalization of nursing. Donations were gathered to recognize her work and used to set up the first nursing school. Nightingale wrote Notes on Nursing in 1859, as a clear, practical guide for home nursing, but it was also used as a textbook in the School for Training Nurses at St. Thomas’s and King’s College Hospitals.  

As Josephine A. Dolan writes in Nursing in Society, Nightingale’s Notes on Nursing  sold “15,000 copies within a month of publication, and by the time of Florence Nightingale’s death well over 100,000 [copies] had been purchased.” Notes on Nursing “gave an enormous stimulus to the study of this subject in England. According to Miss Nightingale nursing ought to signify the proper use of fresh air, light, warmth, cleanliness, quiet, and the selection and administration of diet - all at the least expense of vital force to the patient” (Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th edition).
