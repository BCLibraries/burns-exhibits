Josephine Aloyse Dolan (1913 - 2004), a Rhode Island native, began her nursing career by graduating from St. John's Hospital School of Nursing in Lowell, Massachusetts. She then earned a baccalaureate degree in nursing from Boston University (1942), and, after a year teaching at St. Vincent's Hospital School of Nursing in Bridgeport, Connecticut, returned to BU to complete her masters degree.

Dolan was hired at the University of Connecticut in 1944 as the first instructor in the School of Nursing. At the University of Connecticut, Dolan taught a course on the history of nursing, often using primary sources and historical artifacts to illustrate this subject to her students.

She pursued nursing history for the remainder of her lengthy career, including her work with the Committee on Historic Source Materials in Nursing. Dolan received many honors, including the first National League for Nursing Distinguished Service Award (1972), an honorary degree from Boston College (1987), and the Massachusetts Nurses Association’s Lucy Lincoln Drown Nursing History Society’s award (1992).
