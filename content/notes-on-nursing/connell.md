The Connell School of Nursing was originally established at the request of Richard Cardinal Cushing as the Boston College School of Nursing on January 27, 1947, with 35 registered nurses enrolled for a bachelor of science in nursing or nursing education. The following September, a group of 27 high school graduates enrolled in the baccalaureate program.
In 1958, the master's program was established and offered medical-surgical nursing as a field of concentration. It now offers degrees in advanced practice nursing in several areas of specialization.  The first students entered the PhD in nursing program in 1988. This was the first nursing doctoral program to be offered at a Jesuit university. It has produced graduates who are in various clinical, research, and teaching positions throughout the United States and other countries. An MS/PhD option was introduced in 2000 for individuals seeking preparation in both advanced practice nursing and clinical research.
