Alexandre Olivier Exquemelin (c.1645-1707) was a French-born buccaneer surgeon, and author of the influential *The Buccaneers of America, or a true account of the assaults committed upon the coasts of the West Indies, etc*., which was first published as *De Americaensche Zee-Rovers* in Amsterdam in 1678. Exquemelin traveled to Tortuga as an indentured servant in 1666. He later joined the buccaneers and served under François L’Ollonais and Henry Morgan as a surgeon. He was with Morgan at the sack of Panama in 1671. He returned to Europe, but was in the Caribbean again and participated in the French sack of Cartagena.

William Dampier (1651-1715), was an English buccaneer, navigator and explorer. He circumnavigated the globe three times. His published journals were celebrated for valuable observations of winds, currents, flora and fauna. Dampier influenced the work of Charles Darwin and Daniel Defoe, but his works were also of interest to the early “armchair traveler” in an age of intellectual inquiry.

The text of this book is based on the 5th edition of *The History and Lives of all the most Notorious Pirates and their Crews*, published in 1735. It, in turn, was based upon Captain Charles Johnson’s *A General History of the Pyrates from their first Rise and Settlement in the Island of Providence to the Present Time; With the Remarkable Actions and Adventures of the two Female Pyrates Mary Read and Anne Bonny*, first published in 1724. Charles Johnson was a pen name and the author’s identity is unknown. For a time it was widely believed to be Daniel Defoe.
