The fourth building constructed on Boston College’s Chestnut Hill campus, the library was begun in 1922, opened in 1925 when only partly finished, and was completed and dedicated in 1928. 

A popular place to study -- whether as the only library for the commuter campus of the 1920s-50s or as the “quiet” library (among several Boston College libraries) that it is today -- it has always been one of the most beautiful and most visited sites on campus. In 1952 it was named in honor of BC’s first president, John Bapst, SJ (1815-1887).

As the Boston College student newspaper, The Heights, cheekily observed in a 1968 campus guide, Bapst Library “is one of the most beautiful buildings on campus. That it’s unsuitable for a library is really beside the point.” After the new research library (O’Neill) opened, Bapst received long needed renovations, including  improved public spaces, lighting, and accessibility. Since reopening in 1986, the building houses two separate libraries, Bapst, and the University’s rare books, special collections, and archives library, named for alumnus John J. Burns (1901-1957).    

Reintroduce yourself to a familiar place through this exhibit which illustrates some of the ways this elegant building has served its community for a century.
