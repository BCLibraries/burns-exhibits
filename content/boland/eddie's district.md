Boland was a beloved figure throughout the 2nd District of Massachusetts, especially in the city of Springfield.  Boland excelled at connecting with his constituents, and he received vast amounts of mail from them covering issues such as taxes, social security, terrorism, pollution and the environment, protection of wild horses and burros, and Vietnam. These letters were an important glimpse of what mattered to the people, so Eddie listened and responded.

Boland supported or facilitated a significant number of projects in the 2nd district through grants and funding from the federal government. Business interests and urban development in Springfield was a focal point for Boland, as well as flood control in New England and Western Massachusetts.

One of Boland’s biggest fights and ultimate disappointments was the closure of the Springfield Armory. Located in Springfield, Massachusetts, the Armory began producing military firearms in 1777 and continued manufacturing firearms until its eventual closure in 1968.

The Springfield Armory employed many in Western Massachusetts and supported other industries, so, when U.S. Secretary of State Robert McNamara announced its closure as a cost cutting measure at the height of the Vietnam war, Boland fought hard to prevent it. In 1965, the entire Massachusetts Congressional Delegation met with McNamara in Washington to try to change his mind.

An independent consultant report stated that the Armory closure would have an adverse impact on the economy, but McNamara was not swayed. After a long fight, Boland was forced to concede that the Armory would close in 1968.
