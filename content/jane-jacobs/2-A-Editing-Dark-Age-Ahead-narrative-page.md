**A Cautionary Tale**

Jacobs did not want to leave her readers with a sense of doom and gloom, but rather to raise a cautionary signal. She proposed to title her book *Caution: Dark Age Ahead or A Dark Age Caution*, as indicated by her annotations on the draft typescript shown here. Her publisher later persuaded her to relinquish “caution” in a favor of a shorter, more arresting title.

Random House also changed the dustjacket background color from cream (used for *Systems of Survival* and other books by Jacobs) to a dark red.

**An Inveterate Writer**

Jacobs continuously worked and reworked her writing, sometimes in response to the comments of an editor (as written in green ink on this page from a penultimate draft of Dark Age Ahead), but more often upon her own re-reading (as evidenced by changes she marked in blue ink).
