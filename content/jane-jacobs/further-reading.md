The Jane Jacobs Papers at Burns Library

Unless otherwise noted, all materials displayed in this exhibit are drawn from the Jane Jacobs Papers [(MS1995-029)](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/l6ucgu/ALMA-BC21352764790001021), John J. Burns Library, Boston College. The collection is open and available for use in our reading room; please ask library staff for assistance.

During Jacobs’s third visit to campus in 1993, Burns Librarian Robert O’Neill asked her if she would consider having the library serve as the repository for her personal papers. Her simple reply: “I can’t think of a place I’d rather have them.”
