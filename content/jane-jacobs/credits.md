Sponsored by Boston College Libraries

Curator: Christian Dupont, Burns Library and Associate University Librarian, Special Collections

Orginally Displayed: Burns Library, April 10 – June 23, 2017

**Acknowledgements**

This exhibit was inspired by activities around the centenary of Jacobs’s birth, including talks given on campus last fall by Robert Kanigel and Peter Laurence, who made extensive use of the Jacobs Papers at Burns Library in their biographies. It also owes much to the Boston College faculty who first brought Jacobs to campus in 1987 under the auspices of the Lonergan Institute and PULSE Program for Service Learning, and who remain active as professors and administrators: Patrick Byrne, Richard Carroll (Dick) Keeley, and Fred Lawrence. We are likewise grateful for the support of Sue Lawrence, Kerry Cronin, David Manzo, and Meghan Sweeney, as well as Bing Broderick, Mary Lou Bozza, and Ilona O’Connor of Haley House. We extend special thanks to Jim Jacobs and Caitlin Broms-Jacobs for their contributions and encouragement.
