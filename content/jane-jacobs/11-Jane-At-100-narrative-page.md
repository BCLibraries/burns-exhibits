The centenary of Jacobs’s birth in 2016 occasioned a number of new publications, including biographical studies by Peter Laurence and Robert Kanigel, and a compilation of essays, articles, interviews, and speeches by Jacobs titled Vital Little Plans. Jacobs’s son, Jim, and granddaughter Caitlin organized an exhibition at Toronto’s Urbanspace Gallery that showed how Jacobs lived and worked at home.
In 2009, Cambridge authors Glenna Lang and Marjory Wunsch teamed up with Boston publisher David Godine to produce an illustrated biography of Jacobs for young adult readers, Genius of Common Sense.
