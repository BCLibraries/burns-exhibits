**Mrs. Insight**

Dick Keeley invited Jacobs to BC for a third time in 1993 to participate in a conference that he organized under the auspices of the Carroll School of Management, where he had been appointed associated dean. One of the conference sessions was devoted to Systems of Survival, which Keeley noted Jacobs had decided to cast in the form of a dialogue after reflecting on her experience in the 1987 Lonergan Workshop.

In an enthusiastic thank-you letter following the conference, CSOM dean Donald White referred to the nickname that Bernard Lonergan, SJ, had given her: “Mrs. Insight.”

During the week she spent in Boston in 1993 for the CSOM conference, Jacobs returned to visit Boston’s North End, which she had first seen during the Depression in 1938 and then again in 1960, when she wrote about it in *The Death and Life of Great American Cities*.

In 2000, Jacobs returned to Boston College for a third conference devoted to her work, this time organized through the Law School and its *Environmental Affairs Law Review*.
