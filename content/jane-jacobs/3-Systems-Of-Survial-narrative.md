“Values and Ethics in Making a Living” was the title of a symposium devoted to Jacobs’s work held at Boston College on April 10-11, 1987. Jacobs was invited to give a pair of keynote talks based on her latest research into economic life and ethics. Five years later, with valued input from BC faculty and students, she published *Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics*.

Jacobs’s writings and ideas had become well known to the BC community through Joseph Flanagan, SJ, who served as chair of the philosophy department from 1965-1993. Flanagan created both the Perspectives Program—a four-year interdisciplinary course of study that integrates the humanities with social and natural sciences through the exploration of the great books of Western Culture—and PULSE, a service-learning program that combines the study of philosophy and theology with weekly volunteering at social service agencies. Flanagan introduced many BC faculty and students to Jacobs’s writings, among them fellow Jesuit philosopher and theologian Bernard Lonergan, who taught at BC from 1975 until 1984. Best known for his magisterial *Insight: A Study of Human Understanding*, Lonergan dubbed  Jacobs “Mrs. Insight,” recognizing that her inductive method of reasoning, based on close observation and analysis of particular phenomena, complemented his own.

Yet it was Richard Carroll (Dick) Keeley, then director of the PULSE Program, who was most responsible for bringing Jacobs to campus. Dick Keeley pursued Jacobs for more than a decade: first as an undergraduate then graduate student at Boston College wanting to understand her methods of analysis, and then as director of BC’s PULSE Program, intent on bringing her to campus to share her wisdom in person.

Keeley interviewed Jacobs at her home in Toronto in 1985, and then persuaded her to participate in the 1987 symposium organized by BC’s Lonergan Institute. Jacobs was accepting very few invitations at the time, but the keen interest in her work shown by the BC community convinced her it would be a worthwhile experience.

It was. Lonergan Institute associate director, Kerry Cronin, then a freshman student, recalled Jacobs joining the audience in clapping at the conclusion of her own talks, elated that she had succeeded in sharing with responsive listeners her new insights into economic ethics.

Over the two evenings of the Lonergan Workshop, Jacobs gave a two-part lecture titled “Systems of Economic Ethics,” in which she outlined the two ethical and value systems that she believed governed everyday economic life. She called them “trading” and “raiding,” but later referred to them as the “commercial” and “guardian” syndromes. A handout she prepared lists the traits associated with each configuration.

Jacobs did not travel much, but when she did, her husband often accompanied her. Bob joined her for all of her visits to BC. In a thank-you note following their visit, Jacobs commented: “Both of us were struck by the general atmosphere of the college and the students—such a wonderful combination comes across of intelligence, earnestness and happiness and zest.”

Following the symposium, which included lengthy discussions about her proposals, Jacobs decided to recast her work in progress as a dramatic dialogue modeled on Plato’s *Symposium*, in which the interlocutors articulate and defend opposing viewpoints. She provisionally titled it, “Survival Systems: A Summer Dialogue on Ethics.”

- “People are city-building animals.”
- “Knowledge is a weapon, also an adornment,” said Jasper.
- “Knowledge is a tool,” said Kate. <cite>—Systems of Survival, p. 128</cite>

The proceedings of the 1987 Lonergan Workshop were edited for publication in 1989. The volume included the texts of papers presented at the workshop as well as transcriptions of the question-and-answer sessions that followed Jacobs’s lectures. 

She returned to campus in 1991, sending Keeley a draft to distribute in advance. She recorded a 90-minute conversation with several faculty and participated in a PULSE Council seminar that included five undergraduates along with Keeley and Flanagan. Jacobs expressed her indebtedness to each in the acknowledgements to *Systems of Survival*, which appeared in final form the following year. Professor Richard Nielsen’s critique of “managerial isolation” is referenced directly in a segment of dialogue on organizational self-policing, a theme that re-emerges in Dark Age Ahead.

Jacobs’s *Systems of Survival* was published in 1992. A Japanese translation appeared in 1998.
