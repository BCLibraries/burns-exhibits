Although Jacobs never earned a degree or practiced as an architect, numerous architectural associations recognized her contributions to urban planning. She received the annual Thomas Jefferson Medal in Architecture from the University of Virginia in 1996. In 1998, the American Institute of Architects presented her with a presidential citation and the Toronto Society of Architects granted her a Fellowship Award. In 2003, she was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.
