Jacobs did not regard herself as an activist, but as a thinker and a writer. Yet she did wear the badge and earned her stripes: she organized and led mass protests against urban renewal and expressway projects as well as the Vietnam War, got arrested, and got results.

While Jacobs was writing *Death and Life*, the forces of urban planning that she was critiquing took direct aim at her own neighborhood. Robert Moses, New York City’s “master builder,” proposed to funnel an expressway through Lower Manhattan. Sections of Soho, Little Italy, and Chinatown would be sacrificed.

Jacobs assembled and chaired a coalition committee to fight the project, beating back Moses’s attempts to push it through the city planning commission for more than a decade, dealing it a death blow at a hearing held on April 10, 1968. A large crowd turned out and began chanting “We want Jane!” When she was finally given the microphone, she called other protestors to the platform. Some claim that she tore up the stenographer’s notes so that there would be no official record. Regardless, she was arrested for disorderly conduct, a charge that was eventually dropped. Subsequent newspaper stories turned the mayor and city officials definitively against the expressway, which was quietly abandoned in future city plans.

Meanwhile, protests were mounting against the Vietnam War. The Jacobs, who had two draft-age sons, packed the family car and scrambled up to Canada. The house they rented in Toronto turned out to be in the path of another proposed urban expressway. Jacobs mobilized once again, and helped to lead a successful challenge, getting herself arrested twice during demonstrations. 

Jacobs also influenced the regeneration of Toronto’s St. Lawrence neighborhood. She became a Canadian citizen in 1974. In 1997, the City of Toronto sponsored a conference titled “Jane Jacobs: Ideas That Matter,” which resulted in a book and an annual prize named in her honor. She was invested as an Officer of the Order of Canada the following year, and was awarded the Order of Ontario in 2000.

After Jacobs’s death in 2006, friends decided that instead of advocating for a park or street to be dedicated in her name, it would be more in keeping with her ideals to encourage people to become more familiar with streets in their own neighborhoods by walking them. Every year around Jacobs’s birthday on May 4, “Jane’s Walks,” as they are called, are hosted by volunteer individuals and organizations. So far, more than 200 cities in 40 countries have participated.
