**Rex Stout**

Rex Stout was born on December 1, 1886 in
Noblesville, Indiana, but spent most of his youth in Topeka,
Kansas. In March of 1929 he finished How Like a God, his first
mainstream novel. Shortly after its publication the stock market
crashed. It was at this time he began to consider his fiction as a
way to make a living. After producing four novels he wrote the
first Nero Wolfe novel Fer-de-Lance in 1934. It was the first of 72
novels and novellas he was to write about Nero Wolfe and Archie
Goodwin. These novels brought him fame and a measure of
financial success. Stout spent much of the rest of his life creating
Nero Wolfe novels, but still remained active in a number of
organizations such as the Writers War Boards, the Society for the
Prevention of World War III, The Authors Guild, the Writers
Board for World Government, and Mystery Writers of America.
He died on October 27, 1975 at the age of 89 in High Meadow,
CT.
The collection consists of Stout&#39;s correspondence, financial
records, manuscripts of a number of novels and novellas,
documentation relating to his political activities during and after
the Second World War and his library of about 200 books. Also
included are clippings and other material relating to Stout and
some financial records. Manuscripts of many of Stout&#39;s literary
works comprise a large portion of the collection.

**Peter Hebblethwaite**

{{% figure src="../hebblethwaite.jpg" headline="Peter Hebblethwaite" side="right" %}}

Peter Hebblethwaite was born on September 30, 1930 in
Lancashire, England. In 1948 he became a novice in the Society of
Jesus at Manresa, Roehampton. Graduating from Oxford in 1958,
Hebblethwaite then taught for two years at Mount St. Mary’s,
Spinkhill, and studied theology for four years at Heythrop College.
Following the writing of Hebblethwaite’s first book Bernanos: An
Introduction (1965), he failed his final examinations at Heythrop,
and this precluded him from a career in lecturing. He was sent for a
final year of Jesuit training in France and there he used his literary
skills on the Jesuit magazine The Month. Hebblethwaite was sent
to Rome to cover the final session of the second Vatican Council.
In 1973, Hebblethwaite left the Jesuits, probably because of a
clamp-down on the liberal views espoused by himself and other
Month contributors. Hebblethwaite continued to write for a number
of journals and newspapers on Vatican affairs and the Catholic
Church for the rest of his life. He died in 1994.
The Peter Hebblethwaite Papers contain correspondence pertaining
to the research and publication of Hebblethwaite’s books,
published and unpublished writings, teaching materials, personal
papers, and photographs, as well as an array of printed materials,
sound recordings, and publications. Hebblethwaite’s personal
library of over 2,300 books is also in the collection.

Joseph J. Williams was born in Boston, Massachusetts on
December 1, 1875. In 1893 he entered the Society of Jesus at
Frederick, Maryland. From 1912 to 1917 Williams served as a
missionary in Jamaica. These five years laid the foundation for his
studies in anthropology. Williams gathered archaeological and
anthropological data during his stay on the island. Williams began
lecturing in Boston College&#39;s graduate school in 1932 and became
widely known for his anthropological lectures. He helped establish
the department of anthropology at BC. He also established an
ethnological library containing Africana and Caribbeana; the
library is named in honor of his father, Nicholas M. Williams and
contains over 7,000 volumes. Williams died at Shadowbrook on
October 28, 1940 after suffering a severe heart attack.
The collection compiled by Fr. Williams during his missionary and
academic career primarily documents variations of the Jamaican
Anancy (Anansi) folktale. Other materials pertain to Jamaica, other
Caribbean islands, and/or Africa and include: writings about
people, culture, and language; legal documents (e.g. wills,
indenture agreements); government documents and
correspondence between London and the British colonial
government in Jamaica; maps; lithographs, engravings, and
woodcuts.
