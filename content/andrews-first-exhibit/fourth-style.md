**Binding**

1968's *Wives and Daughters* by Elizabeth Gaskell shows the final binding style of EML.
Overall, it represents the biggest change in format yet. These editions are slightly larger than the
previous ones and feature all new designs for the binding, paste-downs, and title pages. The
binding is similar to the previous style in that it contains the title at the top of the spine, but
"Everyman's Library" has been replaced by an overlapping, cursive "E" and "L"
