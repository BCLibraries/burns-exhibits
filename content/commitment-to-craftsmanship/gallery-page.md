Mark on the joy of crafting bookbindings“It is very satisfying. When done properly, a book has almost an organic feel to it. The cover and the pages become integrated in a unit that moves as one”. 

These books, some of which were bound by Mark Esser, were on display as part of a Boston College class assignment.
