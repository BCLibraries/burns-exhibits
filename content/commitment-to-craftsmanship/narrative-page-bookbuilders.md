Bookbuilders of Boston, a non-profit organization founded in 1937, has a membership representing all areas of the book industry: editing, design, production, manufacturing, and marketing. This organization created a scholarship fund to support, encourage, and promote publishing-related education. Participating educational institutions, such as Boston College, award the scholarships to students who plan to pursue careers in publishing anticipating that, upon graduation, they will contribute their knowledge and unique talent to the field. The Boston College Library has participated in this program since 1992.
