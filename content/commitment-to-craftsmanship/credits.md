+ Amy Braitsch, Head Archivist, provided images from the Heights digital collection.
+ Gary Gilbert, Director, Photography, Office of Marketing Communication, took wonderful pictures of the books.
+ Michael Burns, Special Assistant in Archives & Manuscripts, Burns Library, edited my label and checklist text.
+ Chris Houston-Ponchak, Web Design & Communications Specialist, created the beautiful exhibit posters.
+ Riche Kelly and John Walsh, Burns Library security guards, kept an “eagle eye” on the exhibit cases during the installation of the exhibit.

Beyond Boston College:
