Boston is known for its high quality educational institutions.  The North Bennet Street School (NBSS), incorporated in 1885 by philanthropist Pauline Agassiz Shaw, is the first trade school in the United States, and continues in its mission “to train students for careers in traditional trades that use hand tools in concert with technology, to promote excellence in craft, and to preserve craft traditions.”

The North Bennet Street School maintains a strong connection to the Arts and Crafts movement. The school has evolved through its history, but has remained constant in its commitment to train students for employment using time honored methods. It provides “an education in craftsmanship,” offering courses in bookbinding; cabinet and furniture making; carpentry and preservation carpentry; jewelry making and repair; locksmithing; piano technology; and violin making and restoration.

In this setting, Mark founded the Bookbinding Program and taught classes from 1986 until 1994. The two-year program starts with a comprehensive survey of basic bookbinding techniques. The second year consists of further development of more exacting skills and introduction to book conservation treatments. Walter McDonald, then Associate Director of NBSS said “Mark represents and promotes highest standards of the trade, while teaching students at the bench. We are delighted to have Mark Esser as the person to begin and carry on the Bookbinding program. His background and commitment to craftsmanship will be evident in the work of the graduates of the course.”
