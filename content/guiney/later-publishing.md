In 1897, Guiney sought to introduce the poetry of Irish author James Clarence Mangan (1803-1849) to an American audience. Mangan contributed regularly to *Dublin University Magazine* and the Irish nationalist newspaper *The Nation*, but was little known among Irish immigrants in America. Through her publication of selected poems by Mangan, Guiney also called attention to Dora Sigerson Shorter, the Irish poet and artist who had drawn Mangan’s portrait for the volume’s frontispiece.

In 1904, Guiney published a biographical study of Robert Emmet (1778-1803), the Protestant Irish Republican and Irish nationalist patriot who led an abortive rebellion against British rule and was executed for treason. Describing herself as “chiefly Irish, and as much so on principle as by lineage,” Guiney encouraged Americans to take a fresh look at Emmet as a romantic rebel leader.

Guiney’s final collection of poetry included some tributes to Ireland. Guiney was excited when Sir William Hadow, British educational reformer and musicologist at Worcester College, Oxford, set her “Irish Peasant Song” poem to music, bringing it to a wider audience.

Guiney was descended from English Catholics, known as “recusants” for their refusal to attend the services of the Anglican church, which separated from Roman papal authority during the reign of King Henry VIII, inaugurating the Protestant Reformation in England. Her ancestors were persecuted and eventually exiled, settling in France and Ireland, where her father was born. Guiney took great interest in this heritage, especially following her visits to England and Ireland in the 1890s. She wrote a biography of Edmund Campion, a Jesuit scholar who was martyred in 1581, beatified in 1886, and eventually canonized in 1970.

Guiney spent the last twenty years of her life in England, much of it devoted to gathering information about recusant poets. She died before she could complete her intended book on the subject, but her collaborator, Geoffrey Bliss, SJ, edited and expanded her notes for publication in 1938.

In 1913, Geoffrey Bliss, SJ, was charged with creating an anthology of Catholic poets during England’s penal period. When he learned of Guiney’s extensive research on recusant poets, he proposed a collaboration. Published a decade after her death, Bliss insisted that only her name appear on the title page.
