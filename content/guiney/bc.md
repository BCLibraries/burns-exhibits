The Society of Jesus, a Catholic religious order, was founded by Ignatius of Loyola in 1540. Ignatius encouraged his followers, known as Jesuits, to “find God in all things,” and to dedicate themselves to the “greater glory of God” and good of all humanity. The Jesuits founded educational institutions throughout the world, including Boston College.

Guiney was first introduced to the Society of Jesus as a young child. She attended Mass with her family at the Church of the Immaculate Conception, the church affiliated with the Jesuits and Boston College in Boston’s South End. She regarded a number of Jesuit priests as not only spiritual leaders but friends. She corresponded with Boston College president, Robert Fulton, SJ, and collaborated with other Jesuits on writing projects.

When the Guiney family started attending Masses at the Jesuit Church of the Immaculate Conception, Boston College was in its formative years. Established by the Jesuits in 1863, it is one of 28 Jesuit colleges and universities currently operating in the United States. The school, originally located in Boston’s South End, opened in 1864 with three teachers and 22 students. It shared quarters with Boston College High School until it relocated to the suburban district of Chestnut Hill in 1913.

The Church of the Immaculate Conception welcomed local families such as the Guineys. In his letters, Boston College president, Robert Fulton, SJ, called Guiney’s mother a heroine for the volunteer work she did for the church. He offered more nuanced praise for Guiney’s books: “I like everything about your prose: I like only somethings [sic] in your poetry.”

Fulton  Guiney as a writer, and acknowledged her status as a celebrity, yet cautioned: “I wonder (again)—if the little girl that I knew to be so pious, now growing into a famous woman, in the culture of the intellectual part, improves equally the moral and religious part.”

Guiney considered Thomas Gasson, SJ, a friend, and, in a 1906 letter, called him “a great friend of my Mother’s.” Aware of Guiney’s friendships with English Jesuits and lectures that she had helped them plan, Gasson asked her to arrange for them to visit Boston

By the time Guiney died in 1920, Boston College had outgrown its urban setting and moved to Chestnut Hill. A master plan for the campus was designed by the Boston architectural firm Maginnis and Walsh, which favored the neo-Gothic style championed by Ralph Adams Cram. Guiney counted Cram and then Boston College president Thomas Gasson, SJ, among her friends
