Harps have a long and important history in the cultural life of Ireland. Images of harps can be found from very early in Irish history, such as a bronze shrine from the 11th century depicting a robed figure playing an Irish harp (*cláirseach*). The ancient tradition of harp playing existed for centuries, although the details of how and when harps first arrived are unknown.

In medieval times, the harpers had a high status in the clans of Gaelic Ireland. In an Irish chief’s household, the harper was second in stature only to the official poet. In addition to providing music for various occasions and ceremonies, the harper would accompany a reciter (*reacaire*) in presenting verse composed by the official poet (*file*) to record important events.{{% /largefigure %}}

Harp playing in Ireland was an oral tradition, with the tunes passed from master to pupil. Many harpers were blind, and little is known about the actual music played on the ancient harps, as it was not transcribed.  Early accounts by 12th century Norman priest Giraldus Cambrensis, in his *Topographia Hibernica*, express the highest praise for the rapid fingerwork and musicality of the Irish harpers.

The oldest extant harps are from the 14th century: the Trinity College Harp (Dublin), and the [Queen Mary](https://www.nms.ac.uk/explore-our-collections/stories/scottish-history-and-archaeology/mary-queen-of-scots/mary-queen-of-scots/queen-mary-harp/) and [Lamont Harps](https://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-190-001-134-C) (Edinburgh). The Trinity Harp is the model for the symbol of Ireland on coins, flags and building

In the 16th century, the chieftains began to lose their power and lands, and the role of the professional harper changed. Harpers found patrons in the great houses of Ireland and Scotland. The itinerant harper travelled from house to house, providing music and teaching harp to family members. In Ireland, larger *cláirseachs* were made. Fewer than twenty of these Gaelic harps still exist today, and most are in the National Museum of Ireland. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston holds the [Bunsworth harp](https://www.mfa.org/collections/object/harp-cl%C3%A1irseach-50327) (1734).
