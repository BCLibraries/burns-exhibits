Harps have a long and important history in the cultural life of Ireland, where they underscore connections between music, society, and politics. In medieval times, harpers held a high-status, professional role that disappeared in the mid-17th century with the downfall of the Gaelic aristocracy. In 1792, Edward Bunting transcribed melodies from Ireland’s few remaining harpers at the Belfast Harp Festival. The resulting publication, *[A General Collection of the Ancient Irish Music](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21344993590001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=bcl&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US)*, renewed interest in Ireland’s harp tradition. The harp would come to serve both as a musical instrument and a symbol of national identity. This exhibit uses Irish harps and printed music at the John J. Burns Library to explore the revival of harps in Ireland.
