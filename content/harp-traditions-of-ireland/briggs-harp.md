*“My [Briggs] harp … has travelled with me all over the world from Yukon and Labrador City to the far reaches of New Zealand and Africa and much in between. I have played it in all the major concert halls of the English-speaking world and it has never let me down.”* -- Mary O’Hara, Irish singer and harpist
