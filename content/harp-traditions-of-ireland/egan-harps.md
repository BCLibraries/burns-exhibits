In the 16th century, the chieftains began to lose their power and lands, and the role of the professional harper changed. Harpers found patrons in the great houses of Ireland and Scotland. The itinerant harper travelled from house to house, providing music and teaching harp to family members. In Ireland, larger *cláirseachs* were made. Fewer than twenty of these Gaelic harps still exist today, and most are in the National Museum of Ireland. There is one extremely rare Irish harp, the Bunworth harp (1734) in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

By the end of the 18th century, musical styles had changed and the centuries-old harping tradition was waning. The wire-strung harp had a fixed tuning and its modal music fell out of fashion. By the early 19th century, the harp maker John Egan began to construct a new Portable Irish Harp, in a modern construction, with pieces of wood (maple, spruce), and strung in gut. Egan fitted these harps with ivory ditals, or levers.  The ditals allowed the harps to play in any key, making them more adaptable to modern music. Egan’s harp models facilitated the continuation of the harp tradition in Ireland, and several features of his harps are still used today in the modern Celtic harp. {{% /largefigure %}}
