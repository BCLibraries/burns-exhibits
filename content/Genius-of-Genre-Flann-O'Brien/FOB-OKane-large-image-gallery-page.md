**Artist Statement: Edward O'Kane**

My artwork references the influence of O’Nolan’s youth in Strabane. The writer looks through the framing device of the windows and lace curtains of his birthplace at the townscape that surrounds it. The artworks also address the question of identity and the use of multiple personae in O’Nolan’s writings.

Edward O’Kane, January, 2019

The content and materiality of documents relating to O’Nolan’s former homes in Strabane have inspired me to create an evolving series of paintings. The documents act as a ground upon which disparate fragments can play out an open-ended narrative stimulated by O’Nolan’s novels and authorial personae.

My childhood summers were spent in Strabane, and I have lived across the border in nearby in Lifford since 1975. Examining the physical remains of houses, together with the forensic investigation of deeds, maps, plans, and correspondence relating to the previous owners of these buildings, has led me to believe that many of the descriptions of place, people, and events in O’Nolan’s novels derive from his childhood in Strabane. Many of my paintings are based on imagined views from the windows of the house where he was born.

Macasamhail is the Irish for double or doppelgänger. O’Nolan makes use of this motif in various ways throughout his oeuvre. In Celtic tradition, encountering  one's double is a harbinger of death. The two figures in the painting are based on images of O’Nolan standing beside a window in his birthplace. The church across the road is framed within the window while the curtain motif frames the composition as a whole.

**Artist Statement: David O'Kane**

Rather than illustrating O’Nolan’s writings, my paintings form a dialogue with the ideas and absurd, surreal worlds that he created. The paintings also have a symbiotic relationship with my animated and video artworks. In some cases the paintings act as malleable props within the animated mise-en-scène; in others, the videos suggest compositions for painting.

These three paintings feature in the animated sequence Manufacturing a Countenance. The paintings are based on photographs of O’Nolan held by Burns Library, but rather than portraying a real person, the painting process obscures and masks the original images, disrupting and distorting them into an animated face in flux. O’Nolan’s manipulations of identity are echoed in this metamorphoses.

This painting is inspired by old Phillip Mathers, the murder victim from *The Third Policeman*. He is depicted in a circle of books, each with a different mask placed upon it. The image was originally conceived as the poster for the IV International Flann O’Brien Conference held in Salzburg in 2017. It has since functioned as a study for an animated sequence.

This painting depicts three policemen inspired by the absurd characters in O’Nolan’s novel. They are reminiscent of automata, collaged together from disparate, inhuman elements to create ludicrous and monstrous mechanical figures. They occupy a liminal space beyond logic and rationality that transcends planes of existence. The painting emphasizes their sinister authoritarian undercurrents, which are all the more malevolent and horrific against the backdrop of cruel, apathetic humor.

**Artist's Statement: David O'Kane**

O’Nolan’s verbal labyrinths are peculiarly suited to the type of animation I employ. The very nature of stop-motion and pixilation animation brings objects to life and renders human figures as living puppets, while also hinting at a ghost in the machine constantly manipulating the visual illusion.

I am especially interested in how O’Nolan interrogates language to reveal the arbitrary, uncertain nature of all discourse. The human sense of reality is fundamentally tied to language’s seductive and reassuring reduction of life to taxonomic black and white. However, language also operates on varied levels of ambiguity, and this is where O’Nolan presses it to absurd, illogical limits to reveal a glimpse of the unfathomable beyond.

This animated video was shot at number 17 The Bowling Green in Strabane, County Tyrone, where O’Nolan was born. Situated in what is now Northern Ireland, the house is in semi-derelict condition. I work slowly within the space, allowing the traces of lives lived there and hidden histories to evoke disjointed ideas, which are channeled through the playful atmosphere and attitude of O’Nolan’s writing. Ideas from these and other sources collide with one another to create amorphous, shifting metaphors.

O’Nolan’s metafictional manipulations of identity are paralleled in the metamorphoses of the painted heads in the setting of the artist’s studio. The space itself is telescoped, while time is contracted and repetitious. The series of paintings are displayed in the adjacent case.
