Trade bindings (also known as publishers’ bindings) emerged in the early nineteenth century in Britain and the United States. The desire for durable, cloth-bound books, combined with technological advances in publishing led to the creation of this colorful and attractive book. As the nineteenth century wore on, like many other crafts in the United States, industrial production eventually overtook the smaller-scale craft production of earlier works, and made these books more accessible. By the early twentieth century, the majority of the binding process was mechanized, and publishers employed artists, rather than trade die sinkers, to create eye-catching and attractive covers to boost interest. By the 1920’s, cheaper, dust jacket-style books gained prominence, and these beautiful trade bindings fell out of favor. 

This collection of 80 books was published between the 1850s and the 1930s. The majority of books in this exhibit were published in New York, London, and Boston—however, Edinburgh, Chicago, and Brussels’ published books are also represented.
