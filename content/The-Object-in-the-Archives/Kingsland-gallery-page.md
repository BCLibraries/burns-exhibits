Burns Library is home to the papers and personal library of Hilaire Belloc, a British Catholic author and journalist. When the Kingsland library became part of Burns Libraryâ€™s collection it moved from being a personal collection of books utilized by a family to being an archival collection. These photos show this transformation tracing the transition from personal possession to archival object.
