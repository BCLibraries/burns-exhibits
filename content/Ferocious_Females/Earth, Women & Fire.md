Our category of earthly and fiery women gathers witches, warriors, goddesses, princesses, and blessed virgins together. These women make clear the duality often used in representations of women: the beautiful savior vs the frightening enchantress.

Earth and nature have long been connected with women. Patten’s definitions claim that many believe “the earth was feminine” and describe that “the earth was looked upon as the mould of nature. The sky was the father, for it cast seed into the bosom of the earth, which in receiving them became fruited and brought forth and was the mother.” There is a well-known association between women and nature, but, as with air and water women, there is a ferocious and devilish side of Earth-bound mythological females. 

Warrior women and fearsome females dominate this category. Brunhilde, “Chief of the Fire Maidens or Valkyrie,” commands armies of women. Devil-worshipping witches, who are a “foresight for evil,” are depicted as stealing children and cursing men. Lamia, who Patten describes as having the “head and breasts of a woman, body of a four footed animal with flowing tail, hind feet have divided hoofs'' are “swiftest of four footed animals, very treacherous and cruel to men.” Stories of animalistic, mythical, and witchy women are often configured to scare children. In the entry for “Lamia,” Patten specifically states how they were “female phantom[s] used as a bugbear by Greeks and Romans to frighten children.” These women are described as bitter and shrew-like, often because they cannot or will not have children; therefore, they must be evil. [Image #57]

Contrastingly, nature-tied women can also represent health, healing, and birth too. Hygieia, goddess of health, is described as a giver and also a “protectress of mental health.” Vestal Virgins are “mother goddesses who bestow offspring on women.’ Diana, or Artemis, is both the “patroness of hunting” and “protectress of women in childbirth.” Princess fairy tales, such as Cinderella, often use the heroine as “the personification of truth.” These women are often a sharp juxtaposition to the grossness of witches, instead possessing a kindness and beauty that inspires. [Image #63] 

Just like our previous categories, our women here are pushed into representing a certain side of human nature. They can represent the light or the dark, the good or the evil, but rarely both. Regardless, their power oozes throughout their illustrations and stories. When examining their power, consider the following:  
How do these illustrations of grounded women differ from our previous flying and floating women? Are there also connections between how women are depicted?
“Mother nature” is a common concept around the world. Based on the images below and their connection to both motherhood and the earth, is there bias or is there power in that idea of women? 
Throughout this exhibit we have seen women cast into particular roles, what roles have these earthly women been designated? Where and how can they break from those societally-assigned positions?
