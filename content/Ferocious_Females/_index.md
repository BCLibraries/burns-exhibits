Many of us are familiar with romance as a concept of romantic love, but what if we looked at it in a different way? In literature, romance can be associated with adventure and things remote from everyday life. It evokes glamour, allure, and mystique, qualities of excitement.

In addition to the expected tales of romantic love, Burns Library’s romances are convenient, armchair travel introductions to faraway places and cultures. On display are a few examples of the many Burns Library books that include the word “romance” in the title or subtitle.

If you were going to lose yourself for hours, exploring a different place and time through the pages of a book - no passport or travel required - what would your romance be?
