**Binding**

This 1931 edition of [*Minor Poets of the 17th Century*](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21315611240001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=lib_BURNS&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US) is an example of the second binding
style used by EML from 1928-1934. While still using gilt, it is a simpler floral design than the
previous style. The paste-downs and title pages are the same as in style one. This volume comes
from Graham Greeneâ€™s Library and is a scarce number in EML; only about 8,000 were printed.
