Because of shortages during World War I, some titles in EML printed from 1914-1927 used imitation gold
leaf, and therefore have a faded appearance. This 1914 edition of [*At the Sign of the Cat and
Racket &amp; Other Stories*](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21372482530001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=lib_BURNS&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US) by Balzac is an example of this imitation gold leaf and is easily distinguishable when laid beside one of the real gold volumes. This volume is from Flann O’Brien's Library.

**Quarter Pigskin Binding**

This 1909 edition of [*Essays Literary and Critical*](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21377522700001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=lib_BURNS&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US) by Matthew Arnold is an example of the
rare deluxe binding in quarter pigskin. It has a simpler gilt design and was only available in the
early days of EML, probably not after 1918. The quarter pigskin binding had blank paste-downs.
This edition was owned by Hilaire Belloc.

binding style. Like the quarter pigskin, it was only available in the early years of EML, from
about 1909-1918. It has a decorated spine, but does not bear any mention of being part of EML
on the exterior. It was bound with a silk ribbon book marker. The introduction for this volume
was written by Hilaire Belloc and it comes from the British Catholic Authors Collection.

**Library Binding**


The binding of this 1908 edition of [*A Voyage Round the World in the Years 1740-4*](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21319045120001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=lib_BURNS&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US) by Lord
George Anson was available during the first two styles of EML, from 1906-1934. This sturdy
style was known as the “library binding” and although designed for library use, many were
purchased by individuals. This style has a simpler spine. The title is enclosed in a gilt border
with a loop at the bottom. The loop was left blank for editions published in America by E.P.
Dutton, while English editions published by J.M. Dent had an overlapping “E” and “L” inside
the loop. This edition comes from the Williams Collection.  




**Maroon Leatherette Binding**  
This 1911 edition of [*A Literary and Historical Atlas of America*](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21315650160001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=lib_BURNS&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US) is from the Reference category of EML. The spine design is identical to other contemporary editions, but it also includes a matching gilt floral design on the cover. It is bound in maroon leatherette, has gilt top pages, and is also bound with a silk ribbon book marker. This volume is from the Williams Collection.

**Title Page**

This 1910 edition of [*Warren Hastings: A Biography*](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21331968000001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=lib_BURNS&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US) is an excellent example of the beautiful
title page that editions of EML had until the mid 1930’s. It was designed by Reginald Knowles
and is inspired by the works of William Morris, a 19th century artist who founded the Kelmscott
Press. Each of the thirteen subject areas of EML had a different design and quote. The quote (for
biography) on the left hand side of the image is by John Milton. This volume is from the Williams Collection.

**Paste-down**

This 1911 edition of [*A Tale of a Tub: The Battle of the Books and Other Satires*](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21329655680001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=lib_BURNS&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US) by Jonathan
Swift is an excellent illustration of the paste-downs used by EML from 1906-1934. Like the
title page and spine, it was designed by Reginald Knowles. It features a quote from the medieval
morality play *Everyman*, which is where the series gets its name. The woman pictured is the
character Good Deeds, and the quote was said by her sister, Knowledge. This edition is from the
Irish collection.
