**Binding**

1968's [*Wives and Daughters*](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21372792390001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=lib_BURNS&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US) by Elizabeth Gaskell shows the final binding style of EML.
Overall, it represents the biggest change in format yet. These editions are slightly larger than the
previous ones and feature all new designs for the binding, paste-downs, and title pages. The
binding is similar to the previous style in that it contains the title at the top of the spine, but
"Everyman's Library" has been replaced by an overlapping, cursive "E" and "L"

**Paste-down**

The paste-down for style IV was a simple, repeating pattern of overlapping "E" and "L" which
appear on the spine. This 1967 edition of August Strindberg's [*The Red Room: Scenes of Artistic and Literary Life*](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21373231600001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=lib_BURNS&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US) is one
example. Both examples of Style IV are from Graham Greene's Library.

**Title Page**

The title pages for Style IV of EML were the simplest yet. They had no distinguishing feature
other than a printer's device of a dolphin wrapped around an anchor.
