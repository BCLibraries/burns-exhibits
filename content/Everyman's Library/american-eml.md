This 1950 edition of [*Selected Writings of St. Thomas Aquinas*](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21334640380001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=lib_BURNS&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US) is an example of the New
American Edition of the Everyman's Library. Thirty-two titles were published only in the US,
and were therefore designated with an "A" in the numbering. These editions were slightly
different from their contemporary British cousins, which examples of can be seen in *The Red
Room* and *Wives and Daughters* of Style IV. They were published by Dent's US partner, E.P. Dutton

This 1950 edition of *The World of Washington Irving* shows the title page of the American EML. Again, they tended to be very plain other than a cursive "E" and "L" in a circle.

__Paste-down__  

*The World of Washington Irving* also shows the paste-down of the American EML. They featured the iconic "Everyman" poem along with a stylized floral crossing pattern. The initials "EL" and "EPD" are also found throughout, standing for "Everyman's Library" and "E.P. Dutton" respectively.
