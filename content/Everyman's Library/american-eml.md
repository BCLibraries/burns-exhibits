This 1950 edition of [*Selected Writings of St. Thomas Aquinas*](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21334640380001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=lib_BURNS&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US) is an example of the New
American Edition of the Everyman's Library. Thirty-two titles were published only in the US,
and were therefore designated with an "A" in the numbering. These editions were slightly
different from their contemporary British cousins, which examples of can be seen in *The Red
Room* and *Wives and Daughters* of Style IV.
