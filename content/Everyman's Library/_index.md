The Everyman’s Library (EML) was first conceived in 1905 by the publisher Joseph Malaby
Dent and editor Ernest Rhys. The goal of EML was to create a collection of 1,000 volumes of
classic literature that would appeal to every type of person, from students, scholars and
professionals to the everyday working man. They would be divided into different categories,
originally thirteen in total and have corresponding design attributes. The key to this endeavor
was to make the books affordable, and they were originally available for the very low price of
one schilling. The name “Everyman” comes from the medieval play of the same name in which
the character Knowledge says the following to the character Everyman:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Everyman, I will go with thee*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*and be thy guide,*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*In thy most need to go*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*by thy side.*  


The library began publication in February 1906 and four years later 500 volumes had already
been published. Through two world wars and a depression, the series finally published volume
1,000 in 1956. In 1988 the publishing company J.M. Dent was sold and eventually the Everyman
series was re-launched in the early 1990s. Though very different from the early editions of 1906,
you can still buy Everyman’s Library books through Alfred A. Knopf in the United States and
Random House abroad.
This exhibit has two purposes; first to show the changing styles of EML throughout the many
decades it was in print, and second to show the variety of collections at the Burns Library that
contain volumes of the series. From the Irish collection to the Liturgy and Life Collection, the
personal libraries of authors Rex Stout and Flann O’Brien, copies of the EML can be found in all
of the major collections in the Burns Library.
