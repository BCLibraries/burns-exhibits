One easy way of showing exactly how ubiquitious the Everyman's Library was, is to highlight the fact that almost all of the different collections in Burns Library have at least one EML book among its holdings. From Irish to British Catholic Authors, Rex Stout to Peter Hebblethwait, they can be found among the personal libraries of some of the most influential 20th century writers and throughout our stacks. Following is a brief description of each collection, along with an example of an EML book from the collection.

**Rex Stout Library**

Rex Stout was born on December 1, 1886 in
Noblesville, Indiana, but spent most of his youth in Topeka,
Kansas. In March of 1929 he finished *How Like a God*, his first
mainstream novel. Shortly after its publication the stock market
crashed. It was at this time he began to consider his fiction as a
way to make a living. After producing four novels he wrote the
first Nero Wolfe novel *Fer-de-Lance* in 1934. It was the first of 72
novels and novellas he was to write about Nero Wolfe and Archie
Goodwin. These novels brought him fame and a measure of
financial success. Stout spent much of the rest of his life creating
Nero Wolfe novels, but still remained active in a number of
organizations such as the Writers War Boards, the Society for the
Prevention of World War III, The Authors Guild, the Writers
Board for World Government, and Mystery Writers of America.
He died on October 27, 1975 at the age of 89 in High Meadow,
CT.

documentation relating to his political activities during and after
the Second World War and his library of about 200 books. Also

some financial records. Manuscripts of many of Stout's literary
works comprise a large portion of the collection.

Peter Hebblethwaite was born on September 30, 1930 in
Lancashire, England. In 1948 he became a novice in the Society of
Jesus at Manresa, Roehampton. Graduating from Oxford in 1958,
Hebblethwaite then taught for two years at Mount St. Mary’s,
Spinkhill, and studied theology for four years at Heythrop College.
Following the writing of Hebblethwaite’s first book *Bernanos: An
Introduction* (1965), he failed his final examinations at Heythrop,
and this precluded him from a career in lecturing. He was sent for a
final year of Jesuit training in France and there he used his literary
skills on the Jesuit magazine *The Month*. Hebblethwaite was sent
to Rome to cover the final session of the second Vatican Council.
In 1973, Hebblethwaite left the Jesuits, probably because of a
clamp-down on the liberal views espoused by himself and other
*Month* contributors. Hebblethwaite continued to write for a number
of journals and newspapers on Vatican affairs and the Catholic
Church for the rest of his life. He died in 1994.

to the research and publication of Hebblethwaite’s books,
published and unpublished writings, teaching materials, personal
papers, and photographs, as well as an array of printed materials,

library of over 2,300 books is also in the collection.

Joseph J. Williams was born in Boston, Massachusetts on December 1, 1875. In 1893 he entered the Society of Jesus at Frederick, Maryland. From 1912 to 1917 Williams served as a missionary in Jamaica. These five years laid the foundation for his studies in anthropology. Williams gathered archaeological and anthropological data during his stay on the island. Williams began lecturing in Boston College's graduate school in 1932 and became widely known for his anthropological lectures. He helped establish the department of anthropology at BC. He also established an ethnological library containing Africana and Caribbeana; the library is named in honor of his father, Nicholas M. Williams and contains over 7,000 volumes. Williams died at Shadowbrook on October 28, 1940 after suffering a severe heart attack.

Flann O'Brien is a pen name of Brian O'Nolan, the Irish author,
playwright and satirist, considered a major figure in twentieth
century Irish literature. He was born in Strabane, County Tyrone
and educated in Dublin. O'Nolan worked for the Irish Civil
Service. Regulations generally prohibited Civil Servants from
publicly expressing political views. This meant that writing in
newspapers on current events was generally prohibited without
departmental permission on an article-by-article, publication-by-
publication basis. This is one reason that O'Nolan used pen names.
He published his first novel *At-Swim-Two-Birds* in 1939. It is
considered his greatest work, and is now recognized as one of the
most significant Modernist novels before 1945 and a pioneer
of postmodernism. In later years he won fame for his column "An
Cruiskeen Lawn" in *The Irish Times*. O'Nolan died of a heart
attack on April 1, 1966.

The papers comprise awards, correspondence, clothing, degrees, furniture and personal belongings, literary manuscripts, medals, notes, paintings, passports, photographs, scrapbooks, sketches, theater programs and O’Brien’s personal library of over 300 books.

**Hilaire Belloc Library: King's Land**

The English writer Joseph Hilaire Peter Belloc was born in Celle
Saint-Cloud, France, on 27 July 1870. His mother was an English
citizen, and the family moved to England when Belloc's French
father died. Belloc published *The Bad Child's Book of Beasts*
(1896), a collection of nonsense verse that was so popular it sold
out in four days. In 1902 he published *Path to Rome*, which is
perhaps his most representative work for its combination of
Belloc's love for travel, as well as his fierce Roman Catholicism.
Belloc was decorated with the Grand Cross of the Order of St.
Gregory the Great in 1934 by Pope Pius XI for his devotion to
Catholicism as a writer. Belloc published prolifically over the
course of his life. On July 12, 1953, Belloc accidentally fell into
his fireplace while sleeping beside it. He was badly burned and
died soon afterward on July 16, 1953.

unpublished writings of Hilaire Belloc, including manuscripts,
typescripts, proofs, galleys, and reprints of various articles, essays,
reviews, poetry, plays, prose, notes, and about eighty of Belloc's
books. Also contained in the collection is Belloc's personal library
of about 400 books, named after his house in West Sussex, Kings
Land.

Henry Graham Greene was born on October 4, 1904 in
Berkhamstead, Hertfordshire. Greene endured a difficult childhood,
characterized by depression and attempted suicide. Greene graduated
from Balliol College, Oxford with a BA in history in 1925 and
published a collection of verse, *Babbling April,* the same year. In
1926 Green converted to Catholicism in order to get married.
Catholicism and religion in general became key themes for Greene
throughout his authorial career. Greene's most famous novel, *The
Power and the Glory*, was published in 1940 and cemented his place
among the literary greats of the twentieth-century. In 1941 Greene
joined the Secret Intelligence Service, which propelled him to write
"spy thrillers". From the 1950's—70's Greene travelled extensively
and had multiple romantic relationships that influenced his works.
Greene died from complication of a blood disease on April 3, 1991 in
Switzerland.

of Greene. Correspondence is with a wide range of literary and other
figures and includes copies of Greene's outgoing letters. There are also
various subject files which touch on travel, business and other issues
important to Greene, articles about him, reviews, interviews,
clippings, photographs, and his personal library of over 2,500 books.

The British Catholic Authors Collection features the manuscripts and
published works of leading Catholic writers in the British Isles from
the mid-nineteenth century to the present. Noted especially for its
extensive holdings on Francis Thompson, Hilaire Belloc, and Graham
Greene, this collection also boasts strong holdings on John Henry
Newman, Coventry Patmore, Alice and Wilfrid Meynell, Edith
Sitwell, G. K. Chesterton, Evelyn Waugh, Eric Gill, and Elizabeth
Jennings.

Gerard Manley Hopkins attended Balliol College, Oxford University,
where he excelled in academics. While at Oxford, he converted to
Catholicism in 1868, and burned all of his poems. In 1875 he returned
to writing regularly. In 1877 he was ordained as a Jesuit priest. It was
only after his death in 1889 that his friend, the poet Robert Bridges,
considered having his work published. *Poems* was published
posthumously in 1918. He soon became known as one of the great
religious poets, attaining a popularity which lasts until the present
day.

Leonard, S.J. in 1978 to document the liturgical movement in the American Catholic Church from 1925 to the introduction of the Second Vatican Council's reforms. The collection has grown exponentially to include some 30,000 volumes, and is considered to be the most comprehensive archive in America on the pre-Vatican Catholic Church. The book collection is complemented by sizable holdings of manuscripts, pamphlets, ephemera, artifacts, and photographs.

Noted early on for its strong holdings of books, pamphlets, manuscripts, newspapers, periodicals and landholding records documenting Irish history and society from the late 1700's to the present, the Collection in recent years has made impressive gains in the areas of literature, art (especially the book arts), music, agricultural history, and economic history. Its literary collections of Samuel Beckett, William Butler Yeats and Seamus Heaney, for example, are ranked among the best in the world. To promote greater awareness and use of the impressive holdings, the University in 1991 established [The Burns Library Visiting Scholar in Irish Studies Chair](https://libguides.bc.edu/burnsscholars), which is open on an annual basis to scholars who have distinguished themselves in the areas of Irish history, culture and life.
