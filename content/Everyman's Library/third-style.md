**Binding**

This 1933 edition of [*The Aenid*](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21378029070001021&context=L&vid=bclib_new&search_scope=lib_BURNS&tab=bcl_only&lang=en_US) is an example of the third binding style. It is the
simplest design yet, featuring no floral design work, and only the title at the top of the spine, and
"Everyman's Library" at the bottom. A quirk of EML production was that often books were
printed and stored in batches of 10,000, and they were not bound until orders had been received.
This led to some books being printed during one style, but not bound until another style.
Although this volume was printed during style II, it is bound in style III. It comes from the
King's Land Collection, Hillaire Belloc's personal library.
