An increase in horror stories led to the Comics Code Authority (CCA) formed in 1954 by the Comics Magazine Association of America as an alternative to government regulation, to allow the comic publishers to self-regulate the content of comic books. This ushered in a return to superhero focused stories. More sophisticated stories, usually published by Marvel comics began to appear. Characters were now allowed to doubt themselves and show weaknesses. The artistic styles became more refined and some comic books experimented with different styles, such as surrealism or a cinematic approach that altered the more conventional panel-based format that had been commonplace for decades. Depictions of anatomy, faces, and gestures became more naturalistic. This was still a time of innocence in the comic industry however, there was no social critique, straying from mainstream values, or darker themes.
