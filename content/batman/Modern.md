Along with Alan Moore’s *Watchmen*, *The Dark Knight Returns* is widely credited with beginning the Modern Age of comic books. Stories became much more sophisticated and aimed at older, more well-read audiences. Sexual themes and violence became prevalent. A marketing blitz let to a huge collecting era especially of Gold and Silver age comics. Collector’s editions of important milestone issues were often printed and hoarded by collectors, but as most collectors know, when items are created specifically to be collected, they usually do not end up being valuable. Most of the value of the Gold and Silver Age comics were because of the scarcity of issues. They were often made of cheap materials and not meant to last, similar to newspapers.
