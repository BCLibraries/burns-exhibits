The eldest of nine children, Gerard Manley Hopkins was born into a talented upper middle-class Victorian family who moved early to Hampstead, home to celebrated writers, such as Keats, Shelley, Byron, Coleridge, Hunt, and Lawrence, and to such notable artists as John Constable, whose cloudscapes and landscapes of the Heath memorialize this pastoral, idyllic, romantic spot on the outskirts of London but far from the madding crowd. His father, Manley, was a successful, self-made, business insurance adjuster, entrepreneur, a trustee of the Wells Charity and Board of Management in Hampstead, and a more than amateur poet and author. Among his numerous publications are several collections of poems, one of which, the 1839 illustrated “Heart’s-ease,” is featured in the collection, and books such as *The Cardinal Numbers, A Handbook of Average, Hawaii, The Port of Refuge,* and *Masters: Pietas Metrica; Or, Nature Suggestive of God and Godliness,* written pseudonymously with his brother Thomas Marsland (Brothers Theophilus and Theophylact). *Hawaii* was published in 1862, with a preface by the bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce (“Soapy Sam”), whose review described it as “a credible compendium of all that has been written of late years upon the subject.” Clearly, Manley Hopkins’s literary influence on Gerard was profound. His poem, “The Old Trees,” protesting the cutting down of limes on the Heath, inspired Gerard’s Oxford poem, “Binsey Poplars.”

Gerard’s mother Kate, a not too distant relative of Sydney Smith and Gainsborough, had a better education than most Victorian women and was was well versed in poetry and music, learnt German from her stay in Hamburg, knew some Italian, and spoke French. She married Manley Hopkins in 1843. She was the daughter of Maria and John Simm Smith, a physician. She was also a keen student of history, philosophy, and politics. Kate’s artistic and musical prowess exerted an influence on Gerard. The letters between them evidence the emotional closeness of a mother to her first child. Her sister, Maria Smith, whose artistic abilities approached genius, had an even more profound influence on Gerard’s vision and sketches. She shared her husband’s artistic and intellectual interests, and was also a devout Anglican. Together they had nine children. *Rasselas* by Samuel Johnson is a prize book awarded to her as a young girl and is inscribed to her by her teachers for “good conduct”.

Ann Eleonor, Gerard’s maternal aunt, whose watercolor of the fifteen-year-old (1859) hangs in the National Portrait Gallery, was unmarried, and “deep in archaeology.” She was quite likely his governess until he went to school, and his early drawing teacher. One of his first artistic renderings for her is *Christmas box to Aunt Annie 1853*. Gerard was quite fond of “Aunt Annie,” even describing himself as her “pet.” Uncles on both sides of the family were painters. Richard James Lane (“Uncle Dick”) was a successful lithographer, whose mother was Gainsborough’s niece. Edward Smith, youngest brother to Gerard’s mother, was a professional artist who exhibited at the Royal Academy. Gerard’s brothers, Arthur and Everard, would become artists; one sister sketched, one wrote poetry, and a third assisted him with music. Second child born into the family, Cyril was two years younger than Gerard. Given their birth order, the two were the closest in every way, sharing many literary and academic interests and mutual friendships.

The third child after Gerard and Cyril, Arthur was baptized in water from the River Jordan. The children’s 1863 walking tour or Shanklin on the Isle of Wight was the subject of many of their sketches. Gerard chronicles that experience in his journal: “The sea is brilliantly coloured and always calm, bathing delightful, horses and boats to be obtained, walks wild and beautiful, sketches charming, walking tours and excursions, poetic downs, the lovely Chine, fine cliffs, everything….” While Arthur’s sketches are conventional, Gerard’s show a strong Ruskinian and Turneresque inclination, drawing mostly to capture or inscape nature. You might wish to consult Arthur’s two pieces, *A Gully at Rathwaite 20 August. ’75,* part of the Burns Collection, or *Type of Beauty,* housed in Cambridge, England. Arthur was made an associate member of the Royal Society of Painters in Water-Colour in 1877, and a full member in 1896. The exhibit has one picture of Grace, the eighth of the nine children, and her older sister Kate, who worked closely and communicated regularly with Bridges during his editorial work on the 1918 first edition of the poems. Everard was the last sibling, whose marriage in 1887 occasioned Gerard’s wedding gift of a poem, “Epithalamion.” The two shared a mutual interest in Millais. Last in the collection deserving notice is the darling little Gertrude Frederica, the youngest of three children of Thomas Marsland, Manley’s brother, along with a similar childhood photo of her brother, Clement.
