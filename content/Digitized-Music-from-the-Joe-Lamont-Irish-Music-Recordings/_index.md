Boston College Libraries are pleased to offer selected audio files from [Joe Lamont Irish Music Recordings](http://hdl.handle.net/2345.2/IM-M145-2005) for online streaming. A fiddle player from County Derry, Joseph A. Lamont (1905-1972) immigrated to New York City in 1926. Joe Lamont Irish Music Recordings include performances of Irish traditional music in the greater New York City area. 

The collection of open-reel tapes compiled by Lamont comprise both live music and dubs of 78-rpm sound discs. In most cases, each audio file represents one side of a two-sided reel. Each file lasts approximately ---- minutes and is accompanied by a typed or handwritten tracklist created by Lamont.
