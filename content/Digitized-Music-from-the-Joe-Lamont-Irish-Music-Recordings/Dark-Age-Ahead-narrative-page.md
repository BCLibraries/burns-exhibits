In her last book, Dark Age Ahead, published in 2004, Jacobs expands her earlier analyses of what makes cities successful to encompass the full scope of human civilization in its historical and global dimensions. She prophesies that unless dangerous dynamics are reversed, our culture risks falling into another dark age, when even the knowledge of what has been lost will be lost.

The five main chapters of the book investigate what Jacobs calls “five jeopardized pillars” of North American culture:

- community and family
- higher education
- effective practice of science and science-based technology
- taxes and governmental powers directly in touch with needs and possibilities
- self-policing by the learned professions

Jacobs comments that it may seem surprising that she does not single out such obvious and outward failings as racism, environmental destruction, crime, political distrust, and income inequality. She contends that they are symptomatic of breakdowns in the fundamental domains she analyzes.

Jacobs is particularly critical of trends in higher education that have been turning it into a credentialing process for the sake of economic efficiency rather than preparation for participation in civil society. “Nurturing and instructing human beings in a complex culture demands redundancy of mentors and examples,” she observes, adding: “Redundancy is expensive but indispensable.”
