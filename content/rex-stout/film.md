Columbia Pictures adapted Stout’s books for the big screen twice.  *Meet Nero Wolfe* (1936) featured Edward Arnold as Nero Wolfe and Lionel Stander as Archie Goodwin. Stander also portrayed Goodwin in *The League of Frightened Men* (1937), but Stout was unconvinced that he was right for the role.  The reception for *Meet Nero Wolfe* seems to have been solid; while fans recognized it deviated from Stout’s original work, it was an entertaining and enjoyable mystery. Stout was unhappy with the portrayal of his material in *The League of Frightened Men*, which influenced his rejection of future requests to bring his work to film or television.
