Stout’s mysteries were adapted into a weekly comic strip and later into graphic novels. The comic strip, drawn by Mike Roy, ran from 1956 to 1957, and was printed in newspapers in New York, Indiana, New Jersey, Colorado, Texas, as well as New Zealand, Canada, and Italy.  Stout was supposed to have final approval of the comic’s content and text, which may have made him more comfortable with this adaptation. However, in January 1957, Stout sent a letter to the publisher voicing his displeasure with some of the word choices in the text bubbles, which he claimed had not been sent to him for approval. This may have been why the comic strip had such a short run. The graphic novels on display were printed in France in the 1990s, showing that the Nero Wolfe fandom is strong, even after Stout’s death in 1975.
