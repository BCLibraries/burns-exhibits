Avery was born in Steuben, Maine, to an old New England family with a long history of public service. At the age of 13 she was sent to live with her grandfather when her mother died. Her grandfather enjoyed debating political issues, and this may have influenced Avery. After an apparently unsatisfactory marriage to traveling salesman Millard Fillmore Avery in 1880, and the birth of their daughter Katherine in 1881, Avery left Maine for Boston in 1888.

When Avery was 19, her grandfather set up her in business as a milliner in Ellsworth, Maine. Although her philosophies changed, her penchant for being well-dressed, from her delightful hats to her beaded shoes, remained with her. The David Goldstein and Martha Moore Avery papers include a few of Avery’s personal effects, such as these hatpins and shoes.

**Socialism and the Karl Marx Class**

In Boston Avery was exposed to a wide variety of new philosophies and social reform movements. A Unitarian, she became interested in Theosophy and Christian Science; she also studied metaphysics with Charles D. Sherman and joined the Nationalist Club, an elite Boston organization that supported the nationalization of all industry. Avery soon became dissatisfied with Nationalism, and joined the Socialist Labor Party in 1891. She became such a popular public speaker for the party that she was able to make her living that way. In 1896, she founded the Karl Marx Class (later the Boston School of Political Economy) because she was afraid that American Socialists did not have a clear understanding of Marx’s theories; it was around this time that she met fellow Socialist Labor Party member David Goldstein, who would become her staunchest ally and lifelong friend. In 1900, after an unsuccessful internal coup attempt by Avery, Avery and Goldstein left the Socialist Labor Party and joined the Socialist Party, which had formed from a splinter group dubbed the Kangaroos.

**Katherine Avery and Conversion to Catholicism**

In 1899, Avery sent her daughter Katherine to a Catholic boarding school in Montreal. This had unexpected consequences when Katherine converted to Catholicism in 1900 and became a nun in 1902, taking the name Sister St. Mary Martha. Avery, too, was becoming more interested in religion and specifically the lack of it in Socialism. At the State Convention of the Socialist Party in 1902, Avery and Goldstein quarreled with the leadership about atheism and free love; they introduced a motion to denounce speakers “who attack theological doctrines or dogmas, who advocate violence, free love or other doctrines,” but it was soundly defeated. In response, Avery resigned from the Socialist Party and converted to Catholicism in 1903.

**Break with Socialism**
{{% largefigure src="../035_Socialism.JPG.jpg" headline="" description="Goldstein. [Socialism : the nation of fatherless children](https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/l6ucgu/ALMA-BC21371117850001021). BX1396.3.G65 S62 1903 & LITURGY AND LIFE" size="small" %}}
In 1903 Avery and Goldstein presented their point of view in the jointly authored book, *Socialism: The Nation of Fatherless Children*. It sold well, and Avery and Goldstein adapted the propaganda techniques of Socialism to evangelize for Catholicism, preaching on street corners and giving public lectures about the evils of Socialism. In 1912, they co-founded the Common Cause Society, an Anti-Socialist Catholic workingman's organization that supported organized labor and sought economic and social justice. Avery also lectured on topics of interest to her, often in a complete reversal of her previous stances; she declared her opposition to women’s suffrage, divorce, and birth control.

In 1917, Avery and Goldstein founded their own Catholic public lecture organization, the Catholic Truth Guild (later Catholic Campaigners for Christ). Boston Cardinal William O’Connell gave the organization his blessing in 1917, and she and Goldstein toured in their customized model-T Ford, lecturing on Catholicism. Older than Goldstein by nearly twenty years, Avery limited her lecturing to the Boston area while Goldstein traveled across North America.

Avery was instrumental in founding the Philomatheia Club, a ladies auxiliary to Boston College, in 1915. She served as its first vice-president and in various executive capacities until 1921, when she was recognized with a lifetime honorary vice-presidency. The Club hosted social events (like the garden party) and raised funds for Boston College projects, including scholarships, furniture and equipment, the athletics program, and the first endowed chair.

Avery continued lecturing and advocating for Catholicism and Catholic education until her death on August 8, 1929. This card is likely her funeral card; the phrase “Convert from Marx to Christ” is also engraved on her tombstone.
