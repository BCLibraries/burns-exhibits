{{% largefigure src="../Pole.png" headline="Reginald Cardinal Pole (1500-1558)." size="medium" %}}
Reginald Cardinal Pole (1500-1558) was a crucial player in the complex political drama that led to the creation of the Anglican Church. A grand-nephew of both Edward IV and Richard III, he was also a second cousin and close friend of Henry VIII. However, as a devout Catholic and a personal friend of the Pope, Pole eventually found himself in a difficult position: support the King -- his cousin, benefactor, and friend -- or remain faithful to the Catholic Church. 


Pole chose the Catholic Church, and as his renown as a theologian and papal diplomat grew, so too did the complexity of his relationship with Henry. While he initially sought to remove himself from the coming Anglican/Catholic schism, Pole’s break from the King grew increasingly public. Against his own protestations, the Pope made him a Cardinal. Two years later, Pole was declared a traitor after orchestrating an embargo of England in response to Henry’s defiance of the Church. While Pole was abroad in 1539, his mother and brothers were arrested, charged with supporting his treason, and executed.


Queen Mary would eventually restore Pole to a position of prominence as Archbishop of Canterbury. He was the last Catholic to hold that post and was consecrated the day after the previous Archbishop, Thomas Cranmer, an Anglican, was burned at the stake for heresy.
