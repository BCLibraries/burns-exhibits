New England topics were a subject of Early’s writing throughout the 1930’s and beyond. She wrote And This is Cape Cod!, and “redid” the book later as Cape Cod Summer, by driving around the length of the Cape in an old Ford. She also wrote about Nantucket in An Island Patchwork, gathered up some of her favorite stories in New England Sampler, and covered the Adirondack Mountains of New York in Adirondack Tales.

Early had enjoyed cooking since she was given cooking utensils at age ten and baked bread at twelve to “please papa,” and she enjoyed cooking the foods of the places she visited and including the recipes in her travel books and articles. In New England Cookbook she published hundreds of her favorite New England recipes with background information on them.

When she was a student Early used to go visiting at Dartmouth College to their Winter Carnival, and this led to her third travel book, Behold the White Mountains. The New York Times review of the book stated that her stories, legends, history and associations with famous persons “Mightily imbue with human interest the grand panorama of mountain scenery with which her book is primarily concerned.”
