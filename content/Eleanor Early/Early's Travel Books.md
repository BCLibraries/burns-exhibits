Early’s first travel book, And This is Boston!, which was first published in 1930 and came out in a second edition in 1938, became a best seller and started her on the road to writing travel books. She sent Houghton Mifflin the first two chapters of her proposed book, and under contract turned out the rest of the book in seven weeks. Also shown is the cover of Washington Holiday.

For New Orleans Holiday, Early lived in the spring of 1945 in Beauregard House. Glendy Culligan wrote in the New Orleans Times Picayune that “her book is a potpourri of history, legend, custom and personal impressions, narrated in a style that can only be called irreverent. Some Orleanians will enjoy a touch of debunking, and undoubtedly, some won’t.” The photograph from that time period is of Early at a table in the courtyard of Lafitte’s Bar on Bourbon Street in New Orleans. Originally a blacksmith shop and one of the oldest structures in New Orleans, it survived the New Orleans fires of 1788 and 1794.
