How did people in the past spend their leisure time? Representative objects from Burns Library collections—a chess set, a board game, sketchbooks, and playing cards—can offer insight into the kinds of things people have used to relax throughout time. Some of these objects were gathered by a family over multiple generations, while others come from collections compiled by someone other than the creator, providing an opportunity to see the ways in which human life, and its attendant objects, are not always neatly compartmentalized in time and space. This category of objects often shows signs of wear, such as the worn edges of an often handled sketch, a testament to the enjoyment these things provided as well as a reminder of the ways materiality changes over time and in reaction to human intervention.

R. H. Ives Gammell, a student of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, painted a sequence of 23 images drawn from Thompson’s most famous poem “The Hound of Heaven.” Influenced by Jungian imagery, the paintings are considered Gammell’s most significant work, and contrast with Thompson’s casual sketches displayed below.
