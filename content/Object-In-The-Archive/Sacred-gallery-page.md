The Liturgy and Life Collection—materials that document the liturgical movement in the American Catholic Church from 1925 to the mid 1960s—includes religious artifacts in a myriad of forms. These objects are at the intersection of the sacred and the professional as they work with clergy to perform prescribed holy functions. They also emphasize the practical uses these objects were put to, from directing family members preparing for a sick call from a priest, to fluting the brim of a nun’s wimple. For many devoted Catholic individuals, these materials also served as physical connections to their Catholic faith.

The Ursuline Convent Academy, opened in 1820, was the first Catholic girls’ school in Massachusetts, and was burned down by anti-Catholics in 1834. Elizabeth Williams Hayward, a former student, compiled a collection of papers about the fire; the documents were originally stored in this vellum-covered trunk.

The Sisters of the Holy Cross and the Seven Dolours used this iron to crimp the brims of their wimples. This version was later replaced by a more efficient fluting machine designed by Sister M. Cyril.
