Personal objects make up much of the materiality of everyday human life, preserving memories, scheduling time, and meeting the costuming needs of the human body. These objects are often particularly unique as they retain the shape and impressions of their owner even when removed from the personal setting of the home or the individual. Well-worn shoes, photographs of a family library, and personal calendars all show traces of the humans they once interacted with, breaking down barriers of time and space to offer a glimpse into the day-to-day life of both object and person.

Alice Meynell was a 19th-century poet and author; she and her husband ran and edited the monthly magazine *Merry England* that helped introduce poet Francis Thompson to the literary world. This portrait of Alice was drawn by John Singer Sargent; was Sargent’s portrait of Alice Meynell a good likeness? Compare it to this undated photograph of Alice Meynell (seated) and her friend Agnes Tobin.

Though it may seem unusual to us, locks of hair were often exchanged as keepsakes or remembrances. This bit of hair from author Rex Stout’s beard was sent to John McAleer, his official biographer. Henrietta Persse and one of her sisters sent locks of hair to family friend Mary Doyle Evans.

Graham Greene, a British Catholic author known for his novels such as The Power and the Glory, was also a member of MI-6. His canceled passports show that he traveled extensively, strongly influencing his literary output.

Similar to Graham Greene’s many passports, Nancy Ward Martin’s diaries (also known as planners or schedules) and address books show a life full of activity. The brightly colored books span decades, recording day-to-day errands, outings, and plans. More removed from the immediacy of Mrs. Martin’s diaries, the wax seals of the Ward crest rings encourage us to think about the material means by which a family can be remembered.

John Boyle O’Reilly, an Irish nationalist, was arrested by the British and transported to Australia where he escaped on a New Bedford whaling ship. This sperm whale tooth, a memento of his time at sea, is accompanied by an explanatory note written by O’Reilly’s daughter. This rock was also included in the John Boyle O’Reilly collection, but its significance is unknown, an example of the challenges of provenance, retention, and connection that archivists work with as they process collections for researchers.

This hairbrush and shaving brush are engaging in their familiarity and connotations of personal grooming. John Lawrence Sullivan was a heavyweight, bare-knuckle boxing champion, and William and Michael Hanafin were traditional Irish musicians; all three were part of the Irish community in Boston.

Martha Moore Avery, a former milliner and co-founder of the Catholic Truth Guild with David Goldstein, exemplifies the beauty of the everyday in her clothing. Her well-worn shoes and hatpins, which retain the elegance of a bygone era, were also practical and personal objects.
