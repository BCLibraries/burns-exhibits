front_caption_headline: "Discovering Art in the Archives"
front_caption_text: "Sometimes archives are considered bland, dusty, and (gasp!) boring. Fortunately, there is more to archives than the text in diaries, drafts, letters, memos, and reports. The work of archivists and researchers is more than sorting through mounds of homogeneous paper. Working with archival collections can lead to delightful surprises; some of which we would even call "art." Featuring items selected from Burns Library archival collections, this exhibit proves that beautiful, well-crafted, and sometimes amusing artwork can be found in the most unexpected places. 

Many items were concealed in plain sight, like a beautifully-crafted souvenir scrapbook from the Isle of Springs, which was stored in an ugly box that looked like a solid block of cardboard. A tribunal notebook kept by Irish author Flann O’Brien contains doodles scribbled throughout and shows how some art is serendipitously preserved merely due to its context. Other artistic works—like the embroidery and hand-printing by Cuala Press—were more expected, but still fun finds.

Whether produced casually or professionally, for a functional purpose or to express creativity, art will always be a treat to discover in the archives. We hope you'll find something delightful to draw your attention here.
