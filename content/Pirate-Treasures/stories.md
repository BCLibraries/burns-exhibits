English writer Daniel Defoe (1660–1731) was the author of Robinson Crusoe. One of its likeliest inspirations was the story of castaway Alexander Selkirk, who sailed with – and was later rescued by – William Dampier. Defoe’s second novel, Captain Singleton, included the story of the main character’s experiences as a pirate.
