*The captain himself was a great reader, and used to carry with him aboard his slaveship a quantity of books in two large chests…One of the pirates, upon opening the cases and seeing what was in them, ‘swore There was Jaw-work enough (as he called it) to serve a Nation, and proposed they might be cast into the sea; for he feared that there might be some books amongst them that might breed Mischief enough, and prevent some of their comrades from going on their Voyage to Hell, whither they were all bound; upon which the Books were all flung out of the cabin-window into the River.’*

*This goes to show that even if the average pirate feared neither God nor man, he at least showed a healthy respect for the power of the pen.* -- Philip Gosse, *My Pirate Library*.

Alexandre Olivier Exquemelin (c.1645-1707) was a French-born buccaneer surgeon, and author of the influential *The Buccaneers of America, or a true account of the assaults committed upon the coasts of the West Indies, etc.*, which was first published as *De Americaensche Zee-Rovers* in Amsterdam in 1678. Exquemelin traveled to Tortuga as an indentured servant in 1666. He later joined the buccaneers and served under François L’Ollonais and Henry Morgan as a surgeon. He was with Morgan at the sack of Panama in 1671. He returned to Europe, but was in the Caribbean again and participated in the French sack of Cartagena.

William Dampier (1651-1715), was an English buccaneer, navigator and explorer. He circumnavigated the globe three times. His published journals were celebrated for valuable observations of winds, currents, flora and fauna. Dampier influenced the work of Charles Darwin and Daniel Defoe, but his works were also of interest to the early “armchair traveler” in an age of intellectual inquiry.
