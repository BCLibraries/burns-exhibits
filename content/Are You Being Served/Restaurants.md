Prior to the late eighteenth century, dining outside the home was uncommon and often viewed with some suspicion. Those who did eat in public establishments were usually traders and merchants traveling for business, eating at inns and hostels that offered few choices of dishes. 

The restaurant as we know it today emerged in Paris in the late 1700s as a place for those with delicate constitutions to sip medicinal soups, known as restaurants, or restoratives. By the late 1800s the restaurant had become a fashionable place to see and be seen. Choice of food was a part of the restaurant concept from the start, necessitating a menu. To begin with, menus were often single bills of fare, often chalked on a board and placed in a prominent position for patrons to view.  

As restaurants grew larger and the number of dishes offered also grew, individual handwritten and printed menus were introduced. Early Parisian menus were a large single page, with early printed menus resembling a sheet of newspaper. Then, a small leather bound booklet became fashionable, held together with cord. This was followed by the return to a single printed page menu, smaller and often decorated with illustrations in the style of the day, such as Art Nouveau menus decorated with botanical designs. 

In the rapidly growing cities of nineteenth-century America, a wide range of restaurants existed, catering to everyone from the wealthy to the very poor. At inexpensive restaurants catering to workers, menus were short, simple and written in English, while the restaurants catering to the elite were modeled after French designs, usually with the names of dishes written in French. Menu design favored a small single sheet of paper or a small booklet containing a folded sheet of paper. 

In the twentieth century, menus grew larger, especially during the 1930s, when the trend was quite pronounced.  In the mid-twentieth century, as fast food restaurants, diners and drive-ins became widespread, menu design shifted to reflect a more popular and informal ethos. Menus appeared in the shapes of cars or other objects, and dishes with humorous names became common. Often, too, menus returned to their original place on chalkboards or mounted on walls; this was especially true at diners or drive-ins where menus would often be displayed on a large sign by the counter or order window. 

Even as menus grew large and unwieldy, diners continued to collect them as keepsakes commemorating a particular meal, a trip, or a special occasion. Many menus arrive in the archives as a part of a person’s papers or an institution’s records and are preserved in collections as collateral ephemera. However, they are useful documents in their own right for food historians, sociologists, and graphic designers.
