FOOTBALL: Breaking bread together—at both elaborate and simple affairs—strengthens a sense of community. In its 150 years, Boston College, itself, has been the venue for innumerable celebratory meals, but Eagles also sometimes find themselves far from home. Represented here are souvenirs of informal occasions such as a hotel breakfast in New Orleans, afternoon tea in Chestnut Hill, and supper in a U.S. Navy mess in Manila, along with elaborate and formal banquets at the best hotels in Boston, New York, and elsewhere.

{{< /largefigure >}}Joseph R.N. Maxwell, SJ (1899–1971) was dean of studies at Boston College from 1935 until his appointment as President of the College of the Holy Cross in 1939, at which time the newly-named head of Boston College’s Worcester rival was honored in Boston at the Copley Plaza Hotel. In 1955 Fr. Maxwell was again honored—this time by the Boston College Alumni Association—as he was elevated to the presidency of the Association of American Colleges. He served as the organization’s 41st President—the first Catholic priest to do so. Fr. Maxwell was Boston College’s President from 1951–1958.

The 1928 Eagles were the season’s only undefeated football team on the eastern seaboard. A banquet for the team was hosted by the Boston College Athletic Association at Elks Hotel on Washington Street in Boston.

The menu, below, of the “Formal Installation Dinner” of Louis J. Gallagher, SJ, as Boston College’s 17th President is adorned with literary and scriptural jokes and references to Bolshevik Russia. It illustrates his colleagues’ sense of humor as well as his former role as Assistant Director of the Vatican Relief Mission and his part in the international relief efforts following the Russian famine of 1921.

BOSTON COLLEGE FACULTY

Army Chaplain William J. Leonard, SJ, and a Navy colleague improved this delightful Friday evening supper menu from an officers’ mess in Manila with smart-alecky notes before sending it home to the United States. Fr. Leonard (1909–2000) was a member of the Boston College faculty and later served as Chair of the Philosophy Department. He also was the curator of the Burns Library’s Liturgy and Life collection.
