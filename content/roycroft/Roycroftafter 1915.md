After the untimely death of Elbert Hubbard in 1915, his son Elbert “Bert” Hubbard II kept the press and bindery running until 1938. The quality of the work produced was less innovative than that made during Hubbard Sr.’s lifetime, as Bert often recycled old text block designs, initials, and decorations.  

The number of skilled bookbinders had also declined by 1915. Bert was not a writer, so he re-used the works written by his father. All the content in the volumes below is found in earlier Roycroft editions. The Roycroft dreams of art and glory by no means were lost. Roycroft artisans trained and nurtured by Elbert Hubbard continued to influence the printing and binding communities: Dard Hunter became an authority on papermaking, W.W. Denslow was highly regarded as a book illustrator, and Louis Kinder’s *Formulas for Bookbinders* served to carry on the training taught in the Roycroft Trades School.

*Notebook of Elbert Hubbard* (1927), with the same text, recycled by his son, Bert Hubbard, but different cover styles and prices. One edition has a less expensive printed, cloth-backed paper covering and laces securing the text block. The second—with a brown suede cover stamped with foliage themed borders and gilt stamped titling— would have been higher priced due to more expensive materials.
