William Morris, already well known for his decorative arts—including tapestries, wallpaper, fabrics, furniture, and stained glass windows—founded the Kelmscott Press in 1891. His aesthetic was a major inspiration for the Arts and Crafts movement, which began in England in the 1880s, and quickly spread to North America and Continental Europe. The Arts and Crafts movement incorporated traditional styles and simple, angular forms, especially those from medieval times. From 1891-1898, the Kelmscott Press published over 50 works in 66 volumes. In May 1894, Elbert Hubbard traveled to England and Ireland, visiting the Kelmscott Press and taking inspiration from their work.

The title page of *Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair* (v. 1, 1895) by the Kelmscott Press is an exquisite example of the types of design that the Roycrofters were influenced by and trying to reproduce. The floral motifs can be found throughout the works of the Roycrofters.

*Little Journeys to the Homes of Eminent Artists: Gainsborough* (1902) is a shining example of the title pages found in many of the Roycrofters’ works. The similarities to the Kelmscott press are clearly visible in the layout, font, and floral patterns of the title page.

The colophon, a statement at the end of a book giving information about its authorship and printing, of *Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair* (v. 2,1895) again shows the similar style used by the Roycrofters, down to comparable wording and layout, as can be seen in *White Hyacinths* (1907) below.
