It may seem strange for *Little Journeys to the Homes of Great Musicians: Schumann* (1901) to be part of the Irish collection, but this book is part of a group of about 30 items donated by Martin Broms, about half of which are related to Irish topics.

The Roycrofters were not the only press influenced by William Morris. Cuala Industries was established in 1908 by sisters Elizabeth Corbet Yeats and Lily Yeats, after they left the Dun Emer Guild, which they had founded six years before with Evelyn Gleeson. Cuala Industries included an embroidery, weaving, and tapestry studio; a printing press; and a bindery. Cuala, like Dun Emer before it, was meant to promote Irish crafts made from Irish materials, and to employ Irish women. The majority of its employees were young local girls. Lily ran the embroidery studio; Elizabeth was the director of the printing and bindery portion of the business; and their brother W. B. was the literary editor. Cuala Press printed 66 titles before it ceased publishing books in 1946, including works by W. B. Yeats, George Russell, and Lady Gregory. Cuala Press had difficulty competing with more modern and industrialized publishers and had frequent financial difficulties. After Elizabeth's death in 1940, W. B.'s wife, Georgie, took over as director of the Press until her death in 1968. The below books show how, similar to the Roycrofters, the Cuala press was influenced by the Kelmscott Press. The covers, title pages, and colophon of these Cuala Press books all bear a resemblance to the Kemlscott press, and therefore the Roycrofters.  

All three of the Cuala Press books in the exhibit were donated by James Augustine Healy, a philanthropist and active proponent of Irish literature who donated materials to Boston College and several other institutions.
