*White Hyacinths* (1907) contains a beautiful, illustrated title page by Dard Hunter. It features the stylized Roycrofter font, along with a vine and floral motif. The tailpieces and initials throughout the book have the same green and white motif.

This work contains two preachments—or unwelcome or tedious sermons—by Elbert Hubbard, *The City of Tagaste* and *A Dream and a Prophecy* (1900). This full page illustration was hand-illuminated, or decorated, by Anna Paine and contains her signature at the beginning of the text. The leaves and flower are typical of Roycroft design, but the yellow birds are a nice addition.

Alice Moore Hubbard published *Woman’s Work* (1908) to disseminate her views on women’s suffrage and guaranteed stipends for mothers. Among her many duties for the Roycrofters, Alice was the general manager of the Print Shop. The beautifully designed pages of this book are the work of Dard Hunter.

*The Essay on Self-Reliance* (1908) is a fine example of the high quality paper that many Roycroft books used. One of the Roycrofters, William Joseph "Dard" Hunter became a leading authority on handmade paper. Each sheet contains a watermark featuring the “Roycroft” name and printer’s device of a seahorse and Roycroft orb.
