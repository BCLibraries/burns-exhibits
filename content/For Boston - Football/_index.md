Since even before its first team took the field in Boston’s South End in 1893, Boston College’s enthusiasm for the sport has been recorded. It appears in local newspapers and in the pages of student publications, the Stylus (beginning with the 1894 season), Sub Turri (1912 season), and The Heights (1919 season). Rich in Eagles football history, these sources include not only photographs and articles, but also artwork, editorials, and game and season summaries.

The sport’s most dedicated chroniclers are the Athletics Department’s media relations staff, whose football media guide is an entire history of the sport at Boston College, created anew every year. Other notable authors of published works about Eagles football are alumni Nat Hasenfus ’22 and Reid Oslin ’68, and sportswriter Jack Falla.

This exhibit is a sampling of records held by the Boston College Archives. (For conservation reasons, many in this display are reproductions.) They were created by students and alumni, faculty and administrators, managers and marketers – Superfans!

How can you find these items? Much can be viewed online, including Sub Turri, The Heights, and Stylus. Many photographs are available online and those that are not may be used in the archives, here in the Bapst building. Collections of artifacts, programs, and correspondence are also available on request. Have questions? Contact the Boston College Archives by email or phone, or stop by the Burns Library Reading Room to speak with a staff member.
