Beyond drawing and paintings, McKee also created 3-D art objects and worked in metalwork and jewelry design.  The copper plate, shown here, is an example of her Celtic-inspired metal work.  Original pencil drawings by McKee show designs for jewelry, such as a blister pearl necklace, moonstone rings, and in some cases, designs with multiple options for stones.
