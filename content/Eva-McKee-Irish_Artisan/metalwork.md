Beyond drawing and paintings, McKee also created 3-D art objects. She worked in metalwork and jewelry design while still incorporating the same Irish themes that are found in her drawings and paintings. Original pencil drawings by McKee show designs for jewelry, such as a blister pearl necklace, moonstone rings, and in some cases, designs with multiple options for stones.
