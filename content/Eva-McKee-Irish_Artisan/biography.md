Eva McKee, born in Belfast, Ireland in 1890, was among the artists who championed the Celtic revival of Irish arts and crafts of the 1920s and 30s.  While working with the Irish Decorative Arts Association, McKee studied at the School of Art in Belfast.  With fellow artisan and business partner, Eveline McCloy, she worked to invigorate the association.  McKee and McCloy are credited with making Belfast the foremost center of craftwork in the Celtic or Irish style in the 1920s.  Eva McKee died in 1955.
