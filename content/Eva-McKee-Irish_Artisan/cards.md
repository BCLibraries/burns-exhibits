McKee drawings and paintings, such as the painted cards here, draw on early Celtic designs, such as those found in illuminated manuscripts. The most famous example of the early Celtic illuminated manuscripts is the Book of Kells, currently housed at Trinity College, Dublin, of which Burns Library has a facsimile.  Her artwork highlighted the artistic and literary legacy of Ireland, including Celtic artistic themes as well as quotes from Irish writers or traditional Irish literary works.
