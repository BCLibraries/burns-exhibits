A large section of Burns’s personal library is devoted to corporate leadership and business strategy. Not surprisingly, it includes many volumes relating to the transportation sector, reflecting Burns’s corporate and personal interests. Like the subjects of Rush Loving’s study of the recovery of the railroad industry, Burns loved trains—and trucks.

In 1994, Jim Collins co-authored with Jerry Porras a groundbreaking management study that shattered the myth that only charismatic leaders can build visionary companies. Collins followed Built to Last with Good to Great, the culmination of years of research into practical principles that have enabled leading companies to achieve enduring success. Boston College University Librarian Tom Wall has used Good to Great to develop an organizational culture that promotes innovation in library services.
