At what point does a reader become a book collector?

Burns Library inherited nearly 700 volumes from John J. Burns, Jr., but they represent only a portion of the personal library that he amassed over 60 years.

Burns read the books he bought, and bought books in order to read them. He may not have called himself a “collector,” but his disciplined reading habits resulted in a coherent collection formed around related topics.

How about you? Are you a reader? A collector? Or both?
