John J. Burns, Jr. (1931-2017) was the eldest son of the Honorable John J. Burns (1901-1957), for whom Burns Library was named when it was established in 1986. In this Fatherâ€™s Day photo from 1948, Burns is standing to the right of his father with his four brothers in their family home in nearby Belmont, Massachusetts (not pictured are his mother, Alice, and his two sisters).

Like his father, Burns attended Boston College and earned a graduate degree from Harvard. After a short tour of duty with the US Navy, Burns began his career on Wall Street with Goldman Sachs. Ten years later, he was appointed vice president of Alleghany Corporation, a large railroad and financial holding company. He later served as president, CEO, and chairman of the board, retiring in 2010. In 1965, Burns purchased a majority share in Superior Carriers, a long-haul bulk trucking line. Under his guidance the company became Superior Bulk Logistics, a leading transportation service for food-grade and chemical products.

To sharpen his skills as an investment strategist and executive, Burns studied the careers of business and military leaders, as well as economics and politics, and even music.
