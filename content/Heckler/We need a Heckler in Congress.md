In 1966, Margaret Heckler defied her party and ran in the Republican primary against 42-year incumbent and former Speaker of the House Joseph W. Martin, Jr. Massachusetts Republican party leaders, including Governor John Volpe, opposed her campaign on the grounds that she was an unknown and that Martin was not ready to retire. Also, a planned, party sanctioned successor had already been identified. Heckler ignored her party leadership and declared that no one, not even the governor, had a right to determine who could run.

Dismissed in the newspapers as "petite," "perky," "diminutive and demure," Heckler's campaign style was energetic. Her slogan, "We need a Heckler in Congress!" was revised from her previous successful campaigns for Governor's Council. She campaigned on a platform of bringing true representation to the people of the 10th District, citing Martin's low roll call vote attendance record and lack of visibility on the House floor and in the district. While not attacking his age and illnesses directly, she drew the contrast between a 35 year old lawyer and mother of three and the aging Congressman. Using Martin's own words from his 1924 primary run against an 83 year old incumbent, she argued that constituents need a representative in vigorous health. It paid off, and on September 13, 1966, Heckler defeated Martin to claim the Republican nomination for Congress in the 10th District.

The Democratic party in Massachusetts saw Heckler's win as a benefit to them, believing that it would be easier for the Democratic nominee, Patrick H. Harrington, Jr., to defeat the newcomer. It was also unclear how much support Heckler would have from the state Republican party after her defeat of their candidate. She framed herself as independent, and attacked Harrington's ties to Democratic party leaders. Heckler defeated Harrington in a largely Democratic and Independent district, due to her moderate stance on many issues and her courtship of Democratic voters. After four years on the Governor's Council, Margaret Heckler was headed to Washington.
