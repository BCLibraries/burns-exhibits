Throughout her career, Margaret Heckler kept a sign on her desk that read "Whatever women do they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good. Luckily, this is not difficult." The phrase seems to have summed up her attitude about work and her career in public service. She had a reputation for frenetic energy, and was a tireless champion for women's rights, veterans' benefits, and a "catalyst for caring" while serving as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. Upon her return from Ireland in 1989 she devoted her time to work with Catholic charities and served on numerous boards, including the National Alliance for Hispanic Health. Margaret Heckler passed away on August 6, 2018 in Arlington, Virginia at age 87.
